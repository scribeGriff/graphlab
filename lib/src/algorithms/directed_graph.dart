/**
 * A class to represent a directed graph.
 *
 * Provides methods for building and manipulating a directed graph, such as
 * addNode, addEdge, removeEdge, edgeExists, edgesFrom as well as an iterator
 * getter.  The graph is stored as a HashMap.
 *
 *     DirectedGraph dirgph = new DirectedGraph();
 *     List<List> vertices = new InputListHandler().
 *         array2d('lib/external/vertices.txt');
 *
 *     for (List list in vertices) {
 *       for (var element in list) {
 *         dirgph.addNode(element);
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 *     for (List list in vertices) {
 *       dirgph.addEdge(list[0], list[1]);
 *     }
