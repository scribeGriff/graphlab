/**
 * A disjoint sets ADT implemented with a Union-Find data structure.
 *
 * Performs union-by-rank and path compression.  Elements are represented
 * by ints, numbered from zero.
 *
 * Each disjoint set has one element designated as its root.
 * Negative values indicate the element is the root of a set.  The absolute
 * value of a negative value is the number of elements in the set.
 * Positive values are an index to where the root was last known to be.
 * If the set has been unioned with another, the last known root will point
 * to a more recent root.
